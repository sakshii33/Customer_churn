Customer Churn Analysis Project
Overview:
This project analyzes customer churn within a telecommunications dataset, extracting actionable insights and creating a predictive model to identify at-risk customers. The goal is to enable targeted retention strategies for different customer segments (Loyal, At Risk, Dormant).

Features:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding churn patterns, customer demographics, and service usage.
Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier built to predict customer churn.
Customer Segmentation: Identifies customers as Loyal, At Risk, or Dormant based on prediction results and usage patterns.
Actionable Insights: Enables businesses to tailor marketing and retention strategies for each segment.

Technologies Used:
Python: Pandas, Numpy for data preprocessing and EDA
Scikit-learn for building and evaluating the Random Forest model
Matplotlib for visualizations

How to Use:
1.Clone the Repository
2.Run the Main Script:
Ensure your dataset (WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv) is in the data directory, 
then run: python New.py and pre.py
3.Check Results:
Segmentation files will be saved in the results directory.
Segmentation chart saved as risk_segment_distribution.png.

Conclusion
This project delivers actionable insights for customer retention, guiding targeted interventions and supporting long-term loyalty and growth.
